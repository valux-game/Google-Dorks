**These Google Dork Are Commonly Know**

# What is Google Hacking/Dorking?

**Google Dorking, also known as Google Hacking, is a technique that utilizes advanced search operators to uncover information on the internet that may not be readily available through standard search queries.**

**This strategy takes advantage of the features of Google’s search algorithms to locate specific text strings within search results. Notably, while the term “hacking” suggests an illicit activity, Google Dorking is entirely legal and often used by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities in their systems.**

# How Does Google Dorking Work?

**Google Dorking leverages advanced search operators to refine and pinpoint search results. When combined with keywords or strings, these operators instruct Google’s search algorithm to search for particular information.**

**This method can be used to find files of a particular type, search within a specific website, look for certain keywords in the title of a web page, or even find pages that link to a particular URL. The technique exploits the fact that Google indexes every webpage its crawlers can access, making all information on those pages accessible to anyone looking for it.**

**While Google Dorking can reveal sensitive information if it’s publicly accessible, using this technique doesn’t breach any laws or Google’s terms of service.**

# Different Google Dorking Techniques

**Google Dorking techniques primarily involve using specific search operators. Below are some of the most commonly used methods:**

1.   **Filetype:** This operator searches for specific file types. For example, `filetype:pdf` would return PDF files.
2.   **Inurl:** The `inurl:` operator can be used to find specific words within the URL of a page. For example, `inurl:login` would return pages with ‘login’ in the URL.
3.   **Intext:** With the `intext:` operator, you can search for specific text within the content of a web page. For example, `intext:”password”` would yield pages that contain the word “password”.
4.   **Intitle:** The `intitle:` operator is used to search for specific terms in the title of a webpage. For example, `intitle:”index of”` could reveal web servers with directory listing enabled.
5.   **Link:** The `link:` operator can be used to find pages that link to a specific URL. For example, `link:example.com` would find pages linking to example.com.
6.   **Site:** The `site:` operator allows you to search within a specific site. For example, `site:example.com` would search within example.com.

**These techniques are powerful tools for information gathering and should be used responsibly. While Google Dorking is legal and can be used for legitimate research and security purposes, misuse can violate privacy and potentially be illegal.**
